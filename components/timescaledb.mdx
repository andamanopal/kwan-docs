## Overview

TimescaleDB serves as the primary time-series database in the Alto platform, optimized for storing and analyzing large volumes of time-series data from sensors, equipment, and operational metrics. It provides high-performance storage and retrieval capabilities with advanced time-based query features.

## Data Architecture

### Schema Design

```sql
-- Sensor data hypertable
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
  time        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  sensor_id   TEXT NOT NULL,
  location    TEXT,
  value       DOUBLE PRECISION,
  unit        TEXT,
  quality     INTEGER,
  PRIMARY KEY (time, sensor_id)
);

-- Create hypertable with 1-day chunks
SELECT create_hypertable('sensor_data', 'time',
  chunk_time_interval => INTERVAL '1 day');

-- Equipment performance hypertable
CREATE TABLE equipment_performance (
  time        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  equipment_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  metric_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  value       DOUBLE PRECISION,
  PRIMARY KEY (time, equipment_id, metric_name)
);

SELECT create_hypertable('equipment_performance', 'time',
  chunk_time_interval => INTERVAL '1 day');
```

## Usage Examples

### Data Insertion

```sql
-- Single point insertion
INSERT INTO sensor_data (time, sensor_id, location, value, unit)
VALUES (NOW(), 'temp_001', 'building_01', 23.5, 'C');

-- Batch insertion
INSERT INTO sensor_data (time, sensor_id, location, value, unit)
SELECT
  generate_series(
    NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour',
    NOW(),
    INTERVAL '1 minute'
  ),
  'temp_001',
  'building_01',
  random() * 10 + 20,
  'C';
```

### Query Examples

```sql
-- Time-based aggregation
SELECT
  time_bucket('15 minutes', time) AS interval,
  sensor_id,
  avg(value) AS avg_value,
  max(value) AS max_value,
  min(value) AS min_value
FROM sensor_data
WHERE
  time > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  AND sensor_id LIKE 'temp_%'
GROUP BY interval, sensor_id
ORDER BY interval DESC;

-- Continuous aggregation
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sensor_data_hourly
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT
  time_bucket('1 hour', time) AS bucket,
  sensor_id,
  avg(value) AS avg_value,
  max(value) AS max_value,
  min(value) AS min_value
FROM sensor_data
GROUP BY bucket, sensor_id;
```
